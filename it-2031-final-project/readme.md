News homepage
Design preview for the News homepage coding challenge


The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible (see design above)

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Where to find everything
a) Go to design folder

i) Look at desktop-design.JPG. This is how your website should look.
ii) Look at active-states.JPG. This is how your website should look when you hover mouse over some elements so look for the cursor and how the links change color.
The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding and margin.

Ignore other files inside the design folder.

b) Go to assets folder: All the required assets for this project are in the /assets folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

c) Open style-guide.md. Here you will find recommendations for styles to use for this project.

Building your project
Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Complete and test the project and make sure it closely matches with the web design in the design folder.
